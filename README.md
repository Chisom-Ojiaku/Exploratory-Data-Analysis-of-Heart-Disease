## Exploratory Data Analysis of heart disease data set.

## Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze a heart disease dataset to uncover insights into the relationships between various clinical features and heart disease outcomes. 
The analysis is focused on two main areas : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Correlation Analysis.
## Folder Arrangement
1. Heart.csv - Data
   
2. Images

3. Eda and Correlation code RMD - Code Book

4. Report on the project.

## Summary Statistics: 
Grouping data by the target variable (output) and calculating summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and range for each feature.

## Correlation Analysis:
Evaluating correlations between numeric variables, visualizing the results, and providing an interactive table for easy exploration.

## Key Features
Interactive Summary Statistics: A reactable table with summary statistics allows filtering and searching to explore key clinical features.

Correlation Visualization: A corrplot heatmap highlights relationships between variables, supplemented by an interactive table showing the correlation coefficients.

## Tools and Technologies
1. R: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

2. tidyverse: For streamlined data wrangling and manipulation.

3. reactable: To create interactive tables for better data exploration.

4. corrplot: For visually appealing and informative correlation heatmaps.
